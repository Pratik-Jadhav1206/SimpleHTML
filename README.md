    <h1>World Wonders</h1>
    <h1>Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>

        A pyramid (from Ancient Greek πυραμίς (puramís) 'pyramid')[1][2] is a
        structure whose visible surfaces are triangular in broad outline and
        converge toward the top, making the appearance roughly a pyramid in the
        geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be of any polygon shape, such
        as triangular or quadrilateral, and its surface-lines either filled or
        stepped.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ancient civilizations in many parts of the world pioneered the building of
        pyramids. The largest pyramid by volume is the Mesoamerican Great Pyramid
        of Cholula, in the Mexican state of Puebla. For millennia, the largest
        structures on Earth were pyramids—first the Red Pyramid in the Dashur
        Necropolis and then the Great Pyramid of Khufu, both in Egypt—the latter
        is the only extant example of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

        The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, TAHZH -⁠; Hindi:
        [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble
        mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh,
        India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
        (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it
        also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of
        a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
        and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on
        other phases of the project for another five years. The first ceremony
        held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643,
        of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal
        complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a
        cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2015 would
        be approximately ₹52.8 billion (US$827 million).[4]

        The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified
        Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li
        long wall") is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across
        the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial
        China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian
        Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined
        together in the Qin dynasty.[4][5] Successive dynasties expanded the wall
        system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty
        (1368–1644).
    </p>
    <p>
        To aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks,
        garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or
        fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the
        Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration
        and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along
        the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade.[6]

    <p>Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art
        Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by
        Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor
        Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high,
        excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced
        concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the
        initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project
        organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out
        wide.</p>
    <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>

    <p>Machu Picchu[a] is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain
        ridge at 2,430 meters (7,970 ft).[9] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas",[10] it is the most
        familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within the Urubamba Province[11]
        above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of the city of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows
        past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.[12]</p>
    <p>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[9] In
        2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.[17]</p>
    <h1>Colosseum</h1>
    <img height="300" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/36/162636-050-932C5D49/Colosseum-Rome-Italy.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo], ultimately from Ancient Greek word
        "kolossos" meaning a large statue or giant) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
        Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest
        standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79
        AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications
        were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known
        as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium;
        Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association
        with their family name (Flavius).</p>
    <h1>Chichen Itza</h1>
    <img height="300" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Chichen_Itza_3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Chichén Itzá[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) Yucatec Maya
        pronunciationⓘ was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
        archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]

        Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through
        the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The
        site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc
        and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have
        been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary
        interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</p>
